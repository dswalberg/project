        My name is Derek. Welcome to my website. Here you can find a lot of information about some of the things important to me.
        I included my resume that details some of my experience as a young professional in the Finance industry. I also have some various facts
        about my favorite NFL Football team the Detroit Lions! I've been a fan of the Detroit Lions my whole life because my Dad was born and raised
        near Detroit, Michigan. My grandparents still live there and have helped fuel my love for the team with various fan gear over the years. 
        In the current 2024 season, the Detroit Lions are the best team in both their conference and division. I thought it would be fun to create
        a game that challanges you on different players and their positions. I also made a webpage from scratch that includes a highlight video and some
        infromation about the highest scoring players this season. I hope you enjoy my website as much as I do!
